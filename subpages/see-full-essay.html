		<h1>Self-Contrarian</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>As a graphic designer, I consider my work as visual contributions to the field of psychology, in terms of understanding the concept of communication, or tools and methods of communication, not limited to people sharing ideas or simple conversations among each other. I am often driven by my own experience and memories with design that makes the concept of “sharing” easier. When I have an idea or a concept in mind, my go-to method of communicating it or letting others approach the exact image is designing the hypothetical. I know the purpose of my design has been fully served when I see the “ohh” factor. I design in excitement to see the audience’s reaction when my design successfully assists a client in translating certain ideas or thoughts across, and therefore the audience is delivered the full picture of what the idea would look like in reality. My greatest interests, in relation to how this can be achieved, include 3D modeling and motion graphics, because I think bringing invisible thoughts into a 3-dimensional space is a great way of communicating an idea——it makes the “hypothetical” concept more accessible and understandable to a wider range of audience. The framework of this kind of design is to allow the audience to take a glimpse at the further developed version of the idea——or the further developed world——before it has been developed.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Considering my own perspective in approaching design and communication, I’ve constructed a reexamination of some aspects of the design arts. <span style="background-color: #fff200;">Designers should not be limited to designing just “one thing.”</span> A brilliant design does not necessarily serve one purpose——the designer must have the freedom to include personal aspects into their work as well as an informative background. <span style="background-color: #fff200;">Designers should also not be limited to designing something that is for the sake of convenience</span> Many industrial designs today involve thorough field research in order to make sure the design works effectively. Perhaps by adding a little “arts” aspect to an industrial design, we may be able to widen the range of audience——including ourselves. <span style="background-color: #fff200;">Designers may even want to try designing something that <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> satisfies the designer.</span> We are not very used to this concept, because design——for the most part——is for others to look at. But we cannot deny that this would be a great practice for designers, in terms of understanding the right amount of their own voice playing a role in their work. Besides, one cannot satisfy others if they cannot satisfy themself. <span style="background-color: #fff200;">A way of doing this may include designing something that looks outdated on purpose.</span> In a fast-developing world of technology and trends, we are often too afraid of creating things that are not up to date. By breaking this rule, however, we may be able to access perspectives from other times than just our own. <span style="background-color: #fff200;">I also believe that designing something that is misleading or that delivers absolutely no helpful information is a hidden desire of many modern designers.</span> When we walk into a museum or an art gallery, we tend to make all sorts of interpretations and create our on depths into the works of art we see. But we will never know if the original artist had the exact same thing in mind. Considering that the audience will always be making their own interpretations with whatever is given to them, why not try designing something that doesn’t lead to anything? Another “standard” we are often limited to today is that everything must to utopian and heading towards the brighter future. <span style="background-color: #fff200;">A way to challenge this is to design something that is rather dystopian and depressing.</span> Who knows what kind of bright future the audience will interpret from a dystopian imagery? In relation to designing something that is not informative, <span style="background-color: #fff200;">another way to approach this is by designing something that only contains one level of depth.</span> An example would be the standard rhinoceros illustrations used in printmaking, only for the purpose of practicing and displaying an artist’s skills. After this practice has become standardized, now the rhinoceros is not just a simple drawing, it’s the symbol of advanced printmaking techniques. This is why one cannot ignore a single level of depth. <span style="background-color: #fff200;">This also includes designing something that is just for the sake of showing off the designer’s skills, my eight proposition.</span> How else could we break the standard rule of design? <span style="background-color: #fff200;">We could design something that is hard to see.</span> Design is not only visual, but it’s also generally sensual——including both the physical and the emotional. There are plenty of ways to deliver a message or an emotion through design without having to make it visible. <span style="background-color: #fff200;">Finally, the strongest contrarian way to stand against the standard rules, I believe, is to design something that show no authorship.</span> This could mean collaborative, this could mean lost. But giving up to the fear only stops us from the opportunity to gain further opinions and contributions——therefore further development——from others.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The overall proposition is that “design” does not necessarily have to be about serving an industrial purpose such as making life easier for everybody. The range of design arts should be as wide and free as verbal language——<span style="background-color: #fff200;">artists should be able to simply <span style="font-style: italic;">speak</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">scream</span> their designs,</span> instead of having to present every detail in <span style="font-style: italic;">professional</span> form, as if trying to sell a product. And to do this, it is crucial that we gain a self--contrarian perspective of how we have learned to design. <span style="font-style: italic;">Unlearning</span> is important in the design process as learning.</p>
